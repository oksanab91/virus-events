# Virus Events Viewer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

It is a responsive web application that shows its user a list of potential infection events.


#


## Main libraries and techniques:

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) for elements styling
- [RxJs](https://angular.io/guide/rx-library) to get and manage data
- Store data into client side browser using HTML5 [localStorage](https://javascript.info/localstorage) 
- Simple state management with only Services and RxJS


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
